🚀 **Automatically generate labeled email addresses for better organization and spam protection.**

Email Address Plus adds website-specific labels to your email address when filling forms, making it easy to track where emails come from and organize your inbox.

- **🎯 Multiple Fill Methods**:
  - Floating 📧 icon next to email inputs
  - Right-click context menu
  - Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+Y / Cmd+Shift+Y)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Configure**: Set your email address in the extension settings
2. **Browse**: Visit any website with email input fields

4. **Organized**: Your email gets automatically labeled with the website name

Perfect for organizing newsletters, shopping accounts, and identifying spam sources.

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Install the exact locked dependencies (Node 22 or later)
npm ci

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build extension into .output/firefox-mv2
npm run build

# Lint the built extension (run after build)
npm run lint
```

## 🖼️ Web preview

`preview/` is a permanent gallery of the real popup and options pages,
running bundled against invented `example.*` fixture data through a fake
`browser` API shim. It is excluded from the extension build and the AMO
source zip.

```bash
# Interactive gallery with light/dark frames per fixture
npm run preview

# Static output in preview-dist/ (also what vercel.json deploys)
npm run build:preview
```

Light/dark pinning rewrites the pages' own `prefers-color-scheme` rules, so
the preview never carries a copy of their CSS. In the dev server the pages'
component styles are JS-injected and follow the OS scheme instead; the static
build pins every frame exactly.

## 🏪 Updating the AMO listing

The public add-on page (name, summary, description, categories and screenshots) lives in this repo: `amo/listing.json` for the text, `amo/screenshots/` for the previews (name-sorted, with an optional same-named `.txt` as the caption). The repo is the source of truth, so anything edited by hand on the AMO dashboard gets overwritten on the next push.

```bash
# Dry run: diff against the live listing, send nothing
npx -y @kud/amo-cli@0.1.1 listing push --listing amo/listing.json --guid email-address-plus@kud.io --screenshots amo/screenshots --only=listing,previews

# Send the changes to AMO
npx -y @kud/amo-cli@0.1.1 listing push --listing amo/listing.json --guid email-address-plus@kud.io --screenshots amo/screenshots --only=listing,previews --apply
```

Sending needs `WEB_EXT_API_KEY` and `WEB_EXT_API_SECRET` in the environment (the JWT issuer and secret from [AMO's API credentials page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/)). The description is Markdown, which AMO renders on the page. The work is done by [`@kud/amo-cli`](https://kud.io/projects/amo-cli).
